# LitMod3D 4.0

**LitMod3D** is a software for 3D integrated geophysical-petrological interactive modelling of the lithosphere and underlying upper mantle using a variety of input datasets: potential fields (gravity and magnetic), surface heat flow, elevation (isostasy), seismics, magnetotellurics and geochemical.

**IN PROGRESS**
